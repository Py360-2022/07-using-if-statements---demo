# Instructions  

  ** teacher - demo - do it together using if  **

  ** we will follow the algorithm we created in the slides **

_ Before you test your functions, choose 1 test case, calculate the expected results and put your test cases & results in comments (before the functions).  _ 

  ## Steps
  
  1.  Create a function `letter_grade` use it to implement and test the algorithm we had in the flowchart for letter grade that we saw during  the lecture.   (do not use `input()` nor `print()` inside your function)
    1.  what would be a good parameter to use ?
    2.  what should the function return ?  

  2. test/use the function:
    1. ask the user for the grade 
    3. call your function
    3. display the returned  grade 
 
  3.  after testing with valid grades (1-100) add logic to 
      * return 0 if the grade is > 100 
      * return 0 if the grade is < 0 
      * repeat step 2 to test again
